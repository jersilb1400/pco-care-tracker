Congregant Care Monday - PCO Data Sync

Yes, Monday.com can definitely be configured for congregational care tracking! Here's how you can set this up:
Creating the Care Tracking System
1. Set Up a Board
* Create a new board called "Congregational Care" or "Pastoral Care"
* Add columns for:
    * Person's name
    * Contact information
    * Care type (dropdown: Hospital Visit, Bereavement, Home Visit, etc.)
    * Priority level
    * Assigned care team member
    * Status (New, In Progress, Ongoing, Resolved)
    * Notes/Details
    * Date columns for initial request and follow-ups
2. Create an Intake Form
* Click the "Form" view in your board
* Monday.com automatically generates a form based on your columns
* Customize which fields are required/optional
* Share the form link with staff, or embed it on your website
* Forms can be submitted by staff or even congregation members directly
3. Enable Updates & Communication
* Updates Section: Each item has a built-in updates/activity log where team members can post ongoing updates
* @Mentions: Tag specific care team members in updates
* Files: Attach relevant documents or images
* Subscribers: Team members can follow specific cases to get notifications
Advanced Features for Care Tracking
Automations You Can Set Up:
* Send notifications when new care needs are submitted
* Auto-assign items based on care type
* Send reminders for follow-up visits after X days
* Move items to different groups based on status
Timeline & Calendar Views:
* See all scheduled visits in calendar format
* Track visit history over time
* Set recurring visits for ongoing care needs
Mobile App:
* Update entries from hospital visits in real-time
* Add photos or voice notes to updates
* Get push notifications for urgent needs
Example Workflow
1. Submission: Someone fills out the form reporting "John Smith needs hospital visits"
2. Assignment: Automation assigns it to the pastoral care team, marks priority
3. Initial Visit: Pastor logs visit details in the updates section
4. Ongoing Care: Team members continue adding updates after each visit
5. Coordination: Other staff can see visit history and add their own updates
6. Resolution: Mark as complete when appropriate, archive for records
Privacy Considerations
* Set board permissions so only authorized staff can view
* Use Monday.com's column permissions to hide sensitive information
* Consider using initials or ID numbers instead of full names if needed
The updates feature is particularly powerful because it creates a chronological log of all interactions, making it easy to maintain continuity of care even when different team members are involved. You can also generate reports to track care ministry effectiveness over time.
Would you like specific guidance on setting up any of these features?

Is there a way to email updates into Monday.com for a specific entry once it has been submitted? How do I keep the updates assigned to the original entry even if it is automatically moved to a new group within the board?
Edit

Analyzed Monday.com feature intricacies for email updates and tracking.

6s

The user is asking about two specific Monday.com features:
1. Emailing updates into Monday.com for a specific entry
2. Keeping updates linked to the original entry when it moves between groups
These are good questions about Monday.com's functionality. I should explain both the email integration features and how items maintain their identity when moved.
Yes, Monday.com has excellent email integration features that allow you to email updates directly to specific items! Here's how it works:
Email Updates to Specific Items
1. Item-Specific Email Address
* Every item in Monday.com has a unique email address
* Find it by clicking on an item, then clicking the "..." menu
* Select "Email to this item"
* Copy the unique email address (looks like: pulse-123456789@boards.monday.com)
2. Setting Up Email Integration
* When someone emails to this address, it automatically adds to the Updates section
* The email subject becomes the update title
* Email body becomes the update content
* Attachments are preserved
3. Practical Workflow
* Save important item email addresses in your contacts (e.g., "John Smith - Care Updates")
* Care team members can email updates from anywhere
* Great for quick updates from hospital parking lots or after home visits
Maintaining Item Identity Across Groups
Good news: Items retain their unique ID and all associated data when moved between groups!
What Stays Consistent:
* The unique item email address never changes
* All previous updates/comments remain attached
* File attachments stay linked
* Automation history is preserved
* Subscribers continue to follow the item
Best Practices for Organization:
1. Use Status-Based Groups
    * "New Requests"
    * "Active Care"
    * "Ongoing/Long-term"
    * "Resolved"
2. Set Up Automations    When: Status changes to "Active"
3. Then: Move item to "Active Care" group   
4. Create a Reference System
    * Add a "Case ID" column with unique identifiers
    * Include this ID in email subjects for easy reference
    * Example: "Update: Case #2024-045 - John Smith"
Pro Tips for Email Integration
Email Parsing:
* Set up email templates for consistency
* Monday.com can parse specific formats to update columns
* Example email format:    Visit Type: Hospital
* Duration: 45 minutes
* Next Visit: Thursday
* Notes: Patient improving, family present   
Automation Enhancement:
* Create automation: "When email received, notify assigned person"
* Use keywords in emails to trigger specific actions
* Set up auto-replies confirming update receipt
Integration Options:
* Use Zapier/Make.com to create more complex email workflows
* Forward emails from specific addresses automatically
* Create email filters that add updates to multiple related items
Security Tip: Share item email addresses only with authorized care team members, as anyone with the address can add updates.
This system ensures complete continuity of care documentation regardless of how items move through your workflow stages!

Is there a way to assign the case id automatically to teh entry once the initial form has been submitted?
Edit

Pondered automated case ID assignment methods in Monday.com.

5s

The user is asking about automatically assigning a case ID to entries in Monday.com when forms are submitted. This is a common need for tracking systems. I should explain the various methods available in Monday.com to achieve this, from built-in features to automations and third-party integrations.
Yes! There are several ways to automatically assign case IDs in Monday.com when forms are submitted. Here are the best methods:
Method 1: Auto-Number Column (Simplest)
Built-in Feature:
* Add an "Auto Number" column to your board
* It automatically assigns sequential numbers to each new item
* Format: 1, 2, 3, 4... (incrementing automatically)
* Numbers are permanent and don't change if items are deleted
To set up:
1. Click the "+" to add a column
2. Choose "Auto Number" from column types
3. That's it! Every new form submission gets the next number
Customize the display:
* You can add prefix/suffix in a Formula column
* Example formula: CONCATENATE("CARE-2024-", {Auto Number})
* Results in: CARE-2024-001, CARE-2024-002, etc.
Method 2: Formula Column with Date/Time
For unique IDs with timestamps:

CONCATENATE("CC-", TEXT(TODAY(), "YYMMDD"), "-", {Auto Number})
Results in: CC-241215-045
Or including submission time:

CONCATENATE("CARE-", TEXT({Creation Log}, "YYMMDD-HHmm"))
Results in: CARE-241215-1430
Method 3: Automation + Text Column
More control over format:
1. Create a "Case ID" text column
2. Set up automation:
    * When: Item created
    * Then: Change "Case ID" value to custom format
    * Use variables like {pulse.id} or {date}
Method 4: Advanced Solutions
Using Make.com (formerly Integromat):
* Generate complex IDs based on multiple factors
* Include form submitter initials, department codes, etc.
* Check for duplicates before assigning
Using Monday.com Apps:
* "Unique ID" app from marketplace
* Provides more formatting options
* Can include letters, numbers, and custom patterns
Recommended Setup for Church Care Tracking
1. Create these columns:
* Auto Number (hidden from form)
* Case ID (formula column, visible)
* Creation Date (creation log column)
2. Set formula for Case ID:

CONCATENATE(
  "CARE-",
  TEXT({Creation Date}, "YY"),
  "-",
  IF({Auto Number}<10, "00", IF({Auto Number}<100, "0", "")),
  {Auto Number}
)
This generates IDs like:
* CARE-24-001
* CARE-24-002
* CARE-24-010
* CARE-24-100
3. Add automation for notifications:
* When: Item created
* Then: Send notification including the Case ID
* Provides immediate confirmation with tracking number
Making Case IDs Visible
In forms: Case IDs won't appear in the submission form (since they're generated after submission)
For confirmation:
1. Set up automation to email submitter with Case ID
2. Or redirect to a confirmation page showing the ID
3. Include Case ID in any automated responses
For email updates: Include the Case ID in your saved email address labels:
* "John Smith - CARE-24-045@boards.monday.com"
This system ensures every care need has a unique, trackable identifier from the moment it's submitted, making it easy to reference in communications and maintain continuity across all updates!

Is there a way to set up a notification email back to the form submitter with the submitted information, including the assigned unique case id and an email address they can use to submit new updates?
Edit

Analyzed Monday.com automation possibilities for notification email.

6s

The user wants to know if they can set up an automated notification email in Monday.com that goes back to the form submitter with:
1. The submitted information
2. The assigned unique case ID
3. An email address for submitting updates
This is definitely possible in Monday.com using automations, but there are some specific requirements and limitations to consider.
Yes! You can absolutely set up automated confirmation emails to form submitters with all that information. Here's how:
Setting Up the Confirmation Email System
Step 1: Capture Submitter's Email
In your form, make sure you have:
* An "Email" column (email type)
* Mark it as required in the form settings
* This becomes your "Reply To" address
Step 2: Create the Automation
Navigate to: Board → Automations → Create Automation
Set up this automation:

When: An item is created
Then: Send an email to {Email column}
Step 3: Customize the Email Template
In the automation email builder, you can include:

Subject: Care Request Received - Case #{Case ID}

Dear {Submitter Name},

Thank you for submitting a care request. We've received the following information:

**Case ID:** #{Case ID}
**Name:** {Person Needing Care}
**Care Type:** {Care Type}
**Priority:** {Priority}
**Details:** {Notes}
**Date Submitted:** {Creation Date}

**To submit updates about this case:**
Please send emails to: {item.email}

Or reply to this email with any updates, and they will be automatically added to this case.

Your care team has been notified and will follow up soon.

Blessings,
[Church Name] Care Ministry
Step 4: Include the Item's Email Address
Two ways to include the update email:
1. Using Monday.com variables:
    * In the email template, use {item.email}
    * This automatically inserts the item's unique email address
2. Manual workaround if {item.email} isn't available:
    * Create a formula column that constructs it:
3.    CONCATENATE("pulse-", {Item ID}, "@boards.monday.com")   
    * Reference this column in your email template
Advanced Configuration
Making Updates Even Easier
Option 1: Email Alias
* Create a friendly email alias that forwards to the item
* Example: care-updates-045@yourchurch.org → forwards to → pulse-xxxxx@boards.monday.com
Option 2: Reply-To Setup
* Some email integrations allow setting the Reply-To address
* Configure it to be the item's email address
* Submitters can just hit "reply" to add updates
Complete Automation Recipe

yaml
Trigger: When an item is created
Actions:
  1. Change {Case ID} to "CARE-{YYYY}-{Auto Number}"
  2. Wait 5 seconds (ensures all data is populated)
  3. Send email to {Submitter Email} with:
     - All submitted information
     - Case ID for reference
     - Item email for updates
     - Care team contact info
Including Multiple Recipients
To notify both submitter and care team:
1. Create a second automation for internal notifications
2. Or use the "Send to multiple recipients" option
3. Include different information for each audience
Email Template Best Practices
For the submitter:
* Keep it warm and pastoral
* Include clear next steps
* Provide the case ID prominently
* Make the update email address stand out
Example footer for clarity:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HOW TO SEND UPDATES:
Email: {item.email}
Subject: Update for Case #{Case ID}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Testing Your Setup
1. Create a test form entry
2. Verify the email sends with all variables populated
3. Test the update email by sending to the provided address
4. Check that updates appear in the correct item
Limitations to Note
* Form submitters must provide an email address
* The item.email variable might need to be constructed via formula
* Some email clients might flag automated emails as spam initially
* Consider adding your domain to allowed senders
This system creates a complete communication loop where submitters are informed, have a tracking number, and can easily provide updates throughout the care process!

Using this same plan for a Monday.com board, how would i createa reliable sync to Planning Center Online People records? I am hoping to capture the initial care submission, as well as any updates submitted to the individuals PCO people record.
Edit

Strategized Monday.com and PCO People integration methods and sync.

3s

The user wants to sync their Monday.com care tracking board with Planning Center Online (PCO) People records. This is a great integration question that involves:
1. Initial care submission sync to PCO
2. Ongoing updates sync to PCO
3. Maintaining data integrity between systems
I'll need to cover:
* Available integration methods (Zapier, Make.com, API)
* Field mapping between systems
* How to handle updates
* Best practices for two-way or one-way sync
* PCO People's note system and custom fields
Syncing Monday.com Care Board with Planning Center Online People
Overview of Integration Options
Method 1: Zapier (Easiest)
* Pre-built Monday.com and PCO connectors
* No coding required
* Good for basic syncing
* Costs: Free tier limited; paid plans ~$20+/month
Method 2: Make.com (Most Flexible)
* More complex workflows possible
* Better error handling
* More affordable for high volume
* Costs: Free tier available; paid ~$9+/month
Method 3: Custom API Integration
* Most control and customization
* Requires development resources
* Best for complex requirements
Recommended Setup: Using Make.com
Phase 1: Prepare PCO People
Step 1: Create PCO Custom Fields
1. Go to People → Settings → Custom Fields
2. Create these fields:
    * Care Case ID (Text) - Unique identifier from Monday
    * Care Status (Dropdown) - Active, Resolved, Ongoing
    * Care Type (Dropdown) - Match your Monday options
    * Last Care Update (Date)
Step 2: Enable PCO Notes
* Ensure "Notes" tab is enabled for tracking updates
* Consider creating Note Categories:
    * "Care Updates"
    * "Visit Reports"
    * "Prayer Requests"
Phase 2: Initial Submission Sync
Step 3: Create Make.com Scenario
1. Trigger: Monday.com - "Watch Items"
    * Board: Congregational Care Tracking
    * Watch: "New Items Only"
2. Action 1: Planning Center - "Search People"    Search by: Email
3. Email: {Submitter Email from Monday}   
4. Router: Split the flow
    * Route 1: Person found
    * Route 2: Person not found
5. Route 1 Actions (Person Exists):
    * Update Person:
        * Care Case ID: {Case ID}
        * Care Status: "Active"
        * Care Type: {Care Type}
    * Create Note:    Category: Care Updates
    * Note: New care request submitted
    * Case ID: {Case ID}
    * Type: {Care Type}
    * Priority: {Priority}
    * Details: {Details/Notes}
    * Submitted by: {Submitter Name}   
6. Route 2 Actions (Person Not Found):
    * Create Person:
        * Name: {Person Needing Care}
        * Email: {Submitter Email}
        * Care Case ID: {Case ID}
    * Then continue with same note creation
Phase 3: Ongoing Updates Sync
Step 4: Capture Monday.com Updates
1. New Trigger: Monday.com - "Watch Item Updates"
    * Board: Congregational Care Tracking
    * Update Type: "All Updates"
2. Filter: Only process updates with content    Update text: exists
3. Update text: not empty   
4. Action: Planning Center - "Search People"    Search by: Custom Field
5. Field: Care Case ID
6. Value: {Case ID from Monday}   
7. Action: Create Note in PCO    Category: Care Updates
8. Note: {Update text from Monday}
9. Date: {Update timestamp}
10. Added by: {Update creator}   
Phase 4: Email Updates Integration
Step 5: Process Email Updates to PCO
Since emails to Monday items become updates, they'll automatically flow through the same sync process. However, you can enhance this:
1. Add Text Parser in Make.com:
    * Extract key information from email updates
    * Parse visit dates, duration, outcomes
2. Enhanced PCO Note:    Category: Visit Report
3. Note: Email Update Received
4. 
5. From: {Email sender}
6. Date: {Email timestamp}
7. Content: {Parsed email body}
8. 
9. Case ID: {Case ID}

Add error handlers for:
* Duplicate people in PCO
* Missing email addresses
* Failed API calls
* Rate limiting
Step 9: Testing Protocol
1. Test 1: New submission creates PCO record
2. Test 2: Update in Monday creates PCO note
3. Test 3: Email update flows to PCO
4. Test 4: Multiple updates maintain chronology
Best Practices
Data Integrity
* Unique Identifier: Always use Case ID as the key
* Don't Duplicate: Check existing records before creating
* Maintain History: Never delete, only add notes
* Time Stamps: Include dates on all updates
Privacy Considerations
* Only sync necessary information
* Use PCO's privacy settings appropriately
* Consider who has access to notes
* Don't sync sensitive medical details
Maintenance Plan
* Weekly: Check for failed scenarios
* Monthly: Audit sync accuracy
* Quarterly: Review field mappings
* Annually: Evaluate integration needs
Alternative: Using PCO Workflows
PCO People Workflows Option
1. Create PCO Workflow triggered by custom field change
2. When "Care Case ID" is populated:
    * Add to Care List
    * Notify care team
    * Schedule follow-up
This creates a hybrid where Monday initiates but PCO manages ongoing care tracking.
Monitoring and Reporting
Create PCO Lists for Tracking
* Active Care Cases: Where Care Status = "Active"
* This Week's Visits: Last Care Update within 7 days
* Urgent Needs: Synced from Monday priority
Regular Sync Verification

Make.com Monitoring:
- Set up email alerts for failures
- Log all transactions
- Create weekly summary report
This integration maintains your Monday.com board as the primary care management system while ensuring all updates flow seamlessly into PCO People records for comprehensive member care tracking!

Make.com does not include a planning center online integration. What do i do?
Edit

Investigated alternative solutions for Planning Center Online integration.

11s

The user is correct - Make.com (formerly Integromat) doesn't have a native Planning Center Online integration. This is an important correction. I need to provide alternative solutions that will actually work. Let me think through the options:
1. Zapier - Does have PCO integration
2. Custom webhook solution using Make.com
3. Using PCO's API directly with Make.com's HTTP module
4. Alternative automation platforms
5. Manual or semi-automated solutions
I should revise my recommendations to reflect this reality and provide workable solutions.
You're absolutely right! I apologize for that oversight. Make.com doesn't have a native Planning Center Online integration. Let me provide you with actual working solutions:
Alternative Solutions for Monday.com → PCO Sync
Option 1: Zapier (Easiest Path)
Zapier DOES have both Monday.com and Planning Center integrations.
Setup Process:
1. Create Zap #1 - New Care Requests
    * Trigger: Monday.com "New Item in Board"
    * Action 1: PCO "Find or Create Person"
    * Action 2: PCO "Create Note"
2. Create Zap #2 - Updates
    * Trigger: Monday.com "New Update on Item"
    * Action 1: PCO "Find Person" (by email or custom field)
    * Action 2: PCO "Create Note"
Pros: No code required, maintained by both platforms Cons: More expensive for high volume
Option 2: Make.com with PCO Webhooks & API
Since Make.com doesn't have native PCO support, you'll use HTTP modules:
Setup Requirements:
1. PCO Personal Access Token (not OAuth)
2. Make.com HTTP modules
3. JSON parsing
Basic Make.com Flow:

Monday Trigger → HTTP Request to PCO API → Parse Response → Create/Update in PCO
Example HTTP Configuration:
* Method: GET/POST/PATCH
* URL: https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people
* Headers:
    * Authorization: Basic [base64 encoded token]
    * Content-Type: application/json
Option 3: Custom Middleware Solution
Using a Service Like Pipedream or n8n: Both support Monday.com and have better API handling for services without native integrations.
Pipedream Example:

javascript
// Pipedream workflow
export default defineComponent({
  props: {
    monday: { type: "app", app: "monday" },
    pco: { type: "app", app: "http" } // Custom HTTP for PCO
  },
  async run({ steps, $ }) {
    // Get Monday.com data
    // Make PCO API calls
    // Handle the sync
  }
})
Option 4: Monday.com Apps Framework
Build a Custom Monday App:
1. Use Monday's apps framework
2. Create integration that calls PCO API
3. Add custom actions to your board
Benefits:
* Runs within Monday.com
* Can create custom UI
* Direct API access to both platforms
Recommended Approach: Zapier
Given the lack of native PCO support in Make.com, here's the most reliable path:
Detailed Zapier Setup
Step 1: Connect Your Accounts
1. Create Zapier account
2. Connect Monday.com (API key needed)
3. Connect Planning Center (OAuth login)
Step 2: Create New Submission Zap

Trigger: Monday.com - New Item in Board
├── Filter: Only if status = "New"
├── Action 1: PCO - Find Person
│   └── Search by: Email = {Submitter Email}
├── Path A (Person Found):
│   └── Action: Update Person Custom Fields
│   └── Action: Create Note with care details
└── Path B (Person Not Found):
    └── Action: Create Person
    └── Action: Create Note with care details
Step 3: Create Update Sync Zap

Trigger: Monday.com - New Update to Item
├── Action 1: Get Item Details (to get Case ID)
├── Action 2: PCO - Find Person by Custom Field
│   └── Search: Care Case ID = {Case ID}
└── Action 3: Create Note with update content
Cost Comparison
Service	Free Tier	Paid Starting	Best For
Zapier	100 tasks/mo	$19.99/mo	Simple, reliable
Pipedream	1000 invocations/mo	$19/mo	Technical teams
n8n	Self-hosted free	Cloud from $20/mo	Full control
Custom API	N/A	Development cost	Large scale
Immediate Workaround
If you need something working today:
Semi-Automated Process:
1. Use Monday.com automation to email updates
2. Set up PCO email-to-note feature (if available)
3. Or use Monday.com CSV export → PCO import
Monday Automation Example:

When: Status changes to "New"
Then: Send email to care@yourchurch.org
Include: All item details + Case ID
Then manually process into PCO until automation is ready.
Would you like me to provide detailed setup instructions for the Zapier approach, or explore one of the other options in more depth?

Zpier wil not allow PCO as an action after a trigger.
Edit

Investigated Zapier limitations and devised alternative integration strategies.

4s

The user is saying that Zapier won't allow PCO as an action after a trigger. This is a significant limitation. Let me think about what this means - it sounds like PCO might only be available as a trigger in Zapier, not as an action. This would make it impossible to push data FROM Monday.com TO PCO using Zapier.
I need to provide alternative solutions that will actually work. Let me think of realistic options:
1. Direct API integration using webhooks
2. Using a different automation platform that supports PCO actions
3. Building a custom integration
4. Using Google Sheets as an intermediary
5. Manual processes with automation assists
I should acknowledge this limitation and provide practical workarounds.
You're right - that's a major limitation! If PCO is only available as a trigger in Zapier (not as an action), we need a different approach. Let me provide solutions that will actually work:
Working Solutions Without Direct PCO Actions
Option 1: Monday → Google Sheets → PCO Import
The Flow:
1. Monday.com → Zapier → Google Sheets (automated)
2. Google Sheets → PCO People Import (manual/scheduled)
Setup:

Zapier Automation:
Trigger: Monday.com - New Item
Action: Google Sheets - Create Spreadsheet Row
- Include: Case ID, Name, Email, Care Type, Details, Date
Then either:
* Daily manual import to PCO
* Use PCO's CSV import feature
* Build Google Apps Script for PCO API
Option 2: Direct API Integration with Webhooks
Using Monday.com's Built-in Integration Features:
1. Monday.com Outgoing Webhooks
    * Settings → Developers → Webhooks
    * Send to your endpoint when items created/updated
2. Create Simple Webhook Receiver Using Webhook.site + PCO API:
    * Receive Monday webhook
    * Forward to PCO via API
3. Or use Cloudflare Workers (free tier):    javascript export default {
4.   async fetch(request) {
5.     const data = await request.json();
6.     
7.     // Parse Monday data
8.     const caseId = data.event.columnValues.case_id;
9.     
10.     // Call PCO API
11.     const pcoResponse = await fetch('https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people', {
12.       method: 'POST',
13.       headers: {
14.         'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('app_id:secret'),
15.         'Content-Type': 'application/json'
16.       },
17.       body: JSON.stringify({
18.         data: {
19.           type: 'Person',
20.           attributes: { /* person data */ }
21.         }
22.       })
23.     });
24.     
25.     return new Response('OK');
26.   }
27. };   
Option 3: Use Church Management Bridge Tools
ChurchTrac Connect
* Some churches use ChurchTrac as a bridge
* It can import from spreadsheets and sync to other systems
MinistryPlatform Integration
* If your church uses MP, it might have PCO sync options
Option 4: Build Simple Web App
Using Free/Low-Cost Services:
Replit + Express.js (free hosting):

javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Receive Monday webhook
app.post('/monday-webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const { caseId, name, email, careType } = req.body;
  
  // Call PCO API
  await updatePCO(req.body);
  
  res.send('OK');
});

async function updatePCO(data) {
  // PCO API calls here
}
Option 5: Email-Based Integration
If PCO Accepts Email-to-Note:
Monday Automation:

When: Item created
Then: Send email to: care-notes@yourchurch.planningcenteronline.com
Subject: Care Update - {Case ID}
Body: All care details formatted
Recommended Solution: Google Sheets Bridge
This is the most reliable with minimal technical setup:
Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. Create Google Sheet with columns:
    * Case ID
    * Date Submitted
    * Person Name
    * Email
    * Phone
    * Care Type
    * Priority
    * Details
    * Status
    * Last Updated
2. Set Up Zapier:    Trigger: Monday.com - New Item
3. Action: Google Sheets - Create Row
4. 
5. Trigger: Monday.com - Updated Item
6. Action: Google Sheets - Update Row (lookup by Case ID)   
7. Create PCO Import Process:
    * Weekly: Export new rows from Sheets
    * Import to PCO using their CSV import
    * Use PCO's duplicate matching on email
8. Optional Enhancement: Google Apps Script to auto-import via PCO API:    javascript function syncToPCO() {
9.   const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
10.   const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
11.   
12.   data.forEach(row => {
13.     if (row[9] !== 'Synced') { // Status column
14.       createOrUpdatePCOPerson(row);
15.       sheet.getRange(rowIndex, 10).setValue('Synced');
16.     }
17.   });
18. }   
Quick Win Solution
For Immediate Implementation:
1. Monday Automation → Email to care team
2. Include in email:
    * Direct link to PCO person (if found)
    * All care details
    * Case ID for reference
3. Manual process: Team member adds note to PCO
Email Template:

NEW CARE REQUEST - {Case ID}

Click to view in PCO: 
https://people.planningcenteronline.com/people/search?q={email}

Details:
Name: {Person Needing Care}
Type: {Care Type}
Priority: {Priority}
Notes: {Details}

Please add this as a note in PCO.

Can you provide detailed steps for Option 2.
Edit

Mapped out detailed webhook integration steps for Monday.com.

2s

The user wants detailed steps for Option 2, which is the Direct API Integration with Webhooks approach. I need to provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for setting up webhooks from Monday.com to PCO using various methods. I'll focus on practical implementation details.
Detailed Guide: Direct API Integration with Webhooks
Overview
This solution creates a direct pipeline: Monday.com → Webhook → Your Handler → PCO API
Part 1: Set Up PCO API Access
Step 1: Create PCO Personal Access Token
1. Log in to Planning Center
2. Go to https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/applications
3. Click "Create Personal Access Token"
4. Name it: "Monday.com Care Integration"
5. Save these credentials (you'll see them only once):
    * Application ID: 12345-xxxxx-xxxxx
    * Secret: abcdef123456789...
Step 2: Test PCO API Access
Using a tool like Postman or curl, verify your credentials work:

bash
curl -u "APP_ID:SECRET" https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people?limit=1
You should get a JSON response with people data.
Part 2: Choose Your Webhook Handler
Option A: Cloudflare Workers (Recommended - Free)
Step 1: Create Cloudflare Account
1. Go to cloudflare.com
2. Sign up for free account
3. Navigate to Workers & Pages
Step 2: Create New Worker
1. Click "Create Application" → "Create Worker"
2. Name it: monday-pco-sync
3. Click "Deploy"
Step 3: Add Your Worker Code
Cloudflare Worker - Monday to PCO Sync

The user asked for detailed steps for Option 2, and I've created the Cloudflare Worker code. Now I need to continue with the setup instructions and provide alternatives as well.
Step 4: Add Environment Variables
1. In Cloudflare Worker dashboard, go to Settings → Variables
2. Add these environment variables:
    * PCO_APP_ID = Your PCO Application ID
    * PCO_SECRET = Your PCO Secret
3. Click "Save and Deploy"
Step 5: Get Your Worker URL Your webhook URL will be: https://monday-pco-sync.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
Option B: Pipedream (Visual Workflow Builder)
Step 1: Create Pipedream Account
1. Go to pipedream.com
2. Sign up (free tier includes 100 requests/day)
Step 2: Create New Workflow
1. Click "New" → "New Workflow"
2. Name: "Monday to PCO Sync"
Step 3: Configure Webhook Trigger

Now I need to continue with Part 3 about setting up the Monday.com webhook configuration and testing procedures.
Part 3: Configure Monday.com Webhooks
Step 1: Get Monday.com API Token
1. Go to Monday.com → Avatar → Admin → API
2. Copy your API token
Step 2: Create Webhook Using Monday API
You'll need to use Monday's API to create the webhook. Use this curl command or Postman:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { create_webhook(board_id: YOUR_BOARD_ID, url: \"YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL\", event: create_item) { id } }"
  }'
Replace:
* YOUR_API_TOKEN with your Monday API token
* YOUR_BOARD_ID with your Care Tracking board ID
* YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL with your Cloudflare/Pipedream URL
Step 3: Create Additional Webhooks for Updates
For update tracking, create another webhook:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { create_webhook(board_id: YOUR_BOARD_ID, url: \"YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL\", event: change_column_value) { id } }"
  }'
Alternative: Using Monday.com Apps Framework
Step 1: Create a Monday App
1. Go to monday.com/apps/manage
2. Click "Create App"
3. Choose "Integration" feature
Step 2: Add Integration Recipe
1. Add trigger: "When item is created"
2. Add action: "Send webhook"
3. Configure URL and payload
Part 4: Testing Your Integration
Test 1: Verify Webhook Receipt
Using Cloudflare:
1. Go to your Worker logs
2. Create a test item in Monday
3. Check logs for incoming webhook
Using Pipedream:
1. Workflow automatically shows incoming requests
2. View the event inspector
Test 2: PCO API Connection
Create a simple test item in Monday with:
* Person Name: "Test User"
* Email: "test@example.com"
* Care Type: "Prayer Request"
* Details: "Testing integration"
Verify in PCO:
1. Person created/updated
2. Custom fields populated
3. Note added
Test 3: Update Sync
1. Add an update to the Monday item
2. Check PCO for new note
Part 5: Production Deployment
Security Considerations
1. Add Webhook Verification
Add this to your Cloudflare Worker:

javascript
function verifyMondayWebhook(request, secret) {
  const signature = request.headers.get('Authorization');
  const body = request.body;
  
  // Monday signs webhooks with HMAC-SHA256
  const crypto = require('crypto');
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  hmac.update(body);
  const calculated = hmac.digest('hex');
  
  return signature === calculated;
}
2. Rate Limiting
Add to prevent overwhelming PCO:

javascript
const rateLimiter = {
  requests: new Map(),
  
  async limit(key) {
    const now = Date.now();
    const windowMs = 60000; // 1 minute
    const max = 30; // 30 requests per minute
    
    const requests = this.requests.get(key) || [];
    const recent = requests.filter(time => now - time < windowMs);
    
    if (recent.length >= max) {
      throw new Error('Rate limit exceeded');
    }
    
    recent.push(now);
    this.requests.set(key, recent);
  }
};
Error Handling & Monitoring
1. Add Comprehensive Logging

javascript
async function logError(error, context) {
  console.error({
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    error: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    context: context
  });
  
  // Optionally send to error tracking service
  // await sendToSentry(error, context);
}
2. Implement Retry Logic

javascript
async function retryOperation(operation, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      
      // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => 
        setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, i) * 1000)
      );
    }
  }
}
Monitoring Setup
For Cloudflare Workers:
1. Enable Logpush to send logs to external service
2. Set up Worker Analytics
3. Create alerts for error rates
For Pipedream:
1. Use built-in monitoring
2. Set up email alerts for failures
3. Check execution history regularly
Part 6: Maintenance & Troubleshooting
Common Issues & Solutions
Issue	Cause	Solution
Webhook not firing	Incorrect board ID	Verify board ID in Monday
PCO person not created	Email validation	Check email format
Custom fields not updating	Field ID mismatch	Re-fetch field definitions
Notes duplicating	Multiple webhooks	Check webhook list in Monday
Rate limiting	Too many requests	Implement queuing
Debug Checklist
1. Check Webhook Logs
    * Is Monday sending the webhook?
    * What's the exact payload?
2. Verify PCO Response
    * Log all PCO API responses
    * Check for error messages
3. Test API Manually
    * Use Postman to test PCO endpoints
    * Verify field IDs match
Maintenance Tasks
Weekly:
* Check error logs
* Verify sync accuracy
* Monitor API usage
Monthly:
* Update field mappings if needed
* Review and optimize code
* Check for PCO API changes
Quarterly:
* Audit security settings
* Update dependencies
* Performance optimization
Complete Testing Script
Here's a script to fully test your integration:

javascript
// Test script for validating integration
async function testIntegration() {
  console.log('Starting integration test...');
  
  // Test 1: Webhook connectivity
  console.log('Test 1: Webhook connectivity');
  const webhookTest = await fetch(YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ test: true })
  });
  console.log('Webhook response:', webhookTest.status);
  
  // Test 2: PCO API access
  console.log('Test 2: PCO API access');
  const pcoTest = await fetch('https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people?limit=1', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('APP_ID:SECRET')
    }
  });
  console.log('PCO response:', pcoTest.status);
  
  // Test 3: Create test entry
  console.log('Test 3: Creating test entry');
  // Create item in Monday and verify in PCO
  
  console.log('Integration test complete!');
}
This completes the detailed setup for Option 2. The webhook approach provides real-time syncing with full control over the data flow. Would you like help with any specific part of the implementation?

What curl code should I use to get data from PCO using a specific pco people id?
Edit

Decoded PCO API retrieval strategy for specific person data.

4s

The user wants to know how to retrieve data from Planning Center Online (PCO) for a specific person using their PCO people ID. They need a curl command that will work with the PCO API.
Based on the context from our conversation, they have:
* PCO Application ID
* PCO Secret
* They're working with the People API
The PCO API uses Basic Authentication and follows RESTful patterns. To get a specific person, the endpoint would be: https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/{id}
I should provide:
1. Basic curl command
2. Example with includes for related data
3. How to format the authentication
4. Some useful variations
Here are the curl commands to get data from PCO using a specific person ID:
Basic Person Data

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/PERSON_ID" \
  -u "APP_ID:SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Replace:
* PERSON_ID with the actual PCO person ID (e.g., 123456789)
* APP_ID with your PCO Application ID
* SECRET with your PCO Secret
Person Data with Field Data (Custom Fields)

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/PERSON_ID?include=field_data" \
  -u "APP_ID:SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Person with Multiple Includes

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/PERSON_ID?include=field_data,emails,phone_numbers,addresses,households,notes" \
  -u "APP_ID:SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Using Basic Auth Header Instead
If you prefer to use the Authorization header explicitly:

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/PERSON_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'APP_ID:SECRET' | base64)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Get Person's Notes Only

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/PERSON_ID/notes" \
  -u "APP_ID:SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Get Person's Custom Field Data

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/PERSON_ID/field_data" \
  -u "APP_ID:SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Pretty Print JSON Response
Add | python -m json.tool to format the output:

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/PERSON_ID?include=field_data" \
  -u "APP_ID:SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  | python -m json.tool
Save Response to File

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/PERSON_ID?include=field_data,notes" \
  -u "APP_ID:SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -o person_data.json
Example with Actual Values
If your credentials were:
* App ID: abc123
* Secret: xyz789
* Person ID: 98765432
The command would be:

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people/98765432?include=field_data,notes" \
  -u "abc123:xyz789" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Useful Query Parameters
You can add these to the URL:
* ?include=field_data - Include custom fields
* ?include=notes - Include notes
* ?include=emails,phone_numbers - Multiple includes
* ?fields[Person]=first_name,last_name - Only specific fields
Test Your Connection First
Before trying specific IDs, test your credentials:

bash
curl -X GET "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/me" \
  -u "APP_ID:SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
This returns info about the authenticated application.

Edit

Diagnosed webhook creation issue with Monday.com API token.

5s

The user is getting an error when trying to create a webhook using the Monday.com API. They've provided their actual API token and board ID. Let me analyze the curl command:
1. The command structure looks correct
2. They have an Authorization header with what appears to be a valid JWT token
3. The board_id is provided as a number (9302420826)
4. The URL is their Cloudflare Worker URL
5. The event type is create_item
Common issues with Monday.com webhook creation:
1. Board ID should be a string in GraphQL, not a number
2. The event type might need to be in a different format
3. Authentication issues
4. URL escaping issues
The most likely issue is that the board_id needs to be a string in quotes, not a number.
The issue is that the board_id needs to be a string in the GraphQL mutation, not a number. Here's the corrected curl command:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0aWQiOjUwNDI5MjY3MCwiYWFpIjoxMSwidWlkIjo3MjQzNTU1MSwiaWFkIjoiMjAyNS0wNC0yNFQxNzozNDoxNi4wMDBaIiwicGVyIjoibWU6d3JpdGUiLCJhY3RpZCI6MjA1MDI1MTAsInJnbiI6InVzZTEifQ.sp2Al9PQ-gTQc8V0Ppf5NTBZjYR_q-vdk6hnIEUbusc" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { create_webhook(board_id: \"9302420826\", url: \"https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev/\", event: create_item) { id } }"
  }'
The key change is: board_id: "9302420826" (with quotes) instead of board_id: 9302420826.
Alternative: Using Variables (Cleaner Approach)
You can also use GraphQL variables for a cleaner approach:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0aWQiOjUwNDI5MjY3MCwiYWFpIjoxMSwidWlkIjo3MjQzNTU1MSwiaWFkIjoiMjAyNS0wNC0yNFQxNzozNDoxNi4wMDBaIiwicGVyIjoibWU6d3JpdGUiLCJhY3RpZCI6MjA1MDI1MTAsInJnbiI6InVzZTEifQ.sp2Al9PQ-gTQc8V0Ppf5NTBZjYR_q-vdk6hnIEUbusc" \

    "query": "mutation($boardId: ID!, $url: String!, $event: WebhookEventType!) { create_webhook(board_id: $boardId, url: $url, event: $event) { id, board_id } }",
    "variables": {
      "boardId": "9302420826",
      "url": "https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev/",
      "event": "create_item"
    }
  }'

Common Error Messages
If you still get errors, here's what they might mean:
* "Field 'board_id' doesn't exist" - Using old API version
* "Not authorized" - Token permissions issue
* "Invalid board" - Board ID is wrong or you don't have access
* "Invalid URL" - The webhook URL format is invalid
The string quotes around the board_id should fix your issue!

Diagnosed potential webhook creation issues in Monday.com API.

3s

The user is getting an internal server error when trying to create a webhook in Monday.com. This could be due to several reasons:
1. The webhook URL might need to be accessible/responding
2. There might be an issue with the board permissions
3. The API token might not have the right scopes
4. There might be an issue with the Monday.com API itself
Let me help them troubleshoot this.
The "Internal server error" from Monday.com can happen for a few reasons. Let's troubleshoot:
Step 1: Verify Your Cloudflare Worker is Responding
First, test that your webhook endpoint is working:

bash
curl -X POST https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
You should get a response. If not, make sure your Cloudflare Worker is deployed and returning a response for all requests.
Step 2: Update Your Cloudflare Worker to Accept Any Request
Monday.com might be testing the endpoint before creating the webhook. Update your worker to handle this:

javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    // Handle OPTIONS request (preflight)
    if (request.method === 'OPTIONS') {
      return new Response(null, {
        status: 200,
        headers: {
          'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
          'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, OPTIONS',
          'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type'
        }
      });
    }
    
    // Handle GET request (Monday might test with GET)
    if (request.method === 'GET') {
      return new Response('Webhook endpoint ready', { status: 200 });
    }
    
    // Your existing POST handling code...
    if (request.method === 'POST') {
      // Your existing code
      return new Response('OK', { status: 200 });
    }
    
    return new Response('Method not allowed', { status: 405 });
  }
};
Step 3: Try Creating Webhook with Different Parameters
Sometimes the issue is with specific webhook types. Try this simpler version:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0aWQiOjUwNDI5MjY3MCwiYWFpIjoxMSwidWlkIjo3MjQzNTU1MSwiaWFkIjoiMjAyNS0wNC0yNFQxNzozNDoxNi4wMDBaIiwicGVyIjoibWU6d3JpdGUiLCJhY3RpZCI6MjA1MDI1MTAsInJnbiI6InVzZTEifQ.sp2Al9PQ-gTQc8V0Ppf5NTBZjYR_q-vdk6hnIEUbusc" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { create_webhook(board_id: \"9302420826\", url: \"https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev\", event: create_item) { id } }"
  }'
(Note: removed trailing slash from URL)
Step 4: Verify Board Access
Check that you can access the board:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0aWQiOjUwNDI5MjY3MCwiYWFpIjoxMSwidWlkIjo3MjQzNTU1MSwiaWFkIjoiMjAyNS0wNC0yNFQxNzozNDoxNi4wMDBaIiwicGVyIjoibWU6d3JpdGUiLCJhY3RpZCI6MjA1MDI1MTAsInJnbiI6InVzZTEifQ.sp2Al9PQ-gTQc8V0Ppf5NTBZjYR_q-vdk6hnIEUbusc" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "query { boards(ids: [9302420826]) { id, name } }"
  }'
Step 5: Alternative - Use Monday Apps Instead
If webhooks continue to fail, use Monday's app framework:
1. Go to monday.com/apps/manage
2. Create a new app
3. Add an "Integration Recipe":
    * Trigger: "When an item is created"
    * Action: "Send a webhook"
Step 6: Try with a Public Webhook Testing Service
To isolate if it's your endpoint or Monday's issue:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0aWQiOjUwNDI5MjY3MCwiYWFpIjoxMSwidWlkIjo3MjQzNTU1MSwiaWFkIjoiMjAyNS0wNC0yNFQxNzozNDoxNi4wMDBaIiwicGVyIjoibWU6d3JpdGUiLCJhY3RpZCI6MjA1MDI1MTAsInJnbiI6InVzZTEifQ.sp2Al9PQ-gTQc8V0Ppf5NTBZjYR_q-vdk6hnIEUbusc" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { create_webhook(board_id: \"9302420826\", url: \"https://webhook.site/YOUR-UNIQUE-ID\", event: create_item) { id } }"
  }'
(Get a test URL from webhook.site first)
Step 7: Check API Token Permissions
Your token might need additional scopes. Generate a new token with all permissions:
1. Go to Monday.com → Admin → API
2. Create new token with all scopes selected
If All Else Fails - Use Integromat/Make.com Differently
Since Make.com doesn't have native PCO support but DOES have Monday.com support, you could:
1. Use Make.com to receive Monday webhooks
2. Use HTTP modules in Make to call PCO API
3. This avoids the Monday webhook creation issue
The internal server error is often related to Monday.com not being able to validate the webhook endpoint. Make sure your Cloudflare worker is responding to all request types with a 200 status code.

Diagnosed Cloudflare Worker deployment issue and debugging strategy.

2s

The user is getting an "Internal error" when trying to access their Cloudflare Worker directly. This means the Worker has an error in its code or isn't deployed properly. I need to help them debug and fix their Cloudflare Worker.
The "Internal error" means your Cloudflare Worker has a code error or isn't properly deployed. Let's fix this step by step:
Step 1: Check Worker Status
Go to your Cloudflare dashboard:
1. Navigate to Workers & Pages
2. Click on monday-pco-sync
3. Check if it shows as "Active"
Step 2: Check Worker Logs
In the Worker dashboard:
1. Click on "Logs" tab
2. Click "Begin log stream"
3. Try the curl command again
4. See what error appears
Step 3: Deploy a Minimal Working Worker
Let's start with a basic worker that just responds to any request:
Minimal Cloudflare Worker - Test Version
Code 
export default { async fetch(request, env, ctx) { // Log the incoming request console.log('Received request:', request.method, request.url); // Handle different request methods if (request.method === 'OPTIONS') { return n
Plotted worker deployment and PCO integration strategy.

1s

I've created a minimal worker that should work. Now I need to guide them through deploying it and then gradually adding the PCO integration functionality.
Step 4: Deploy the Minimal Worker
1. In your Cloudflare Worker dashboard, click "Quick Edit"
2. Replace ALL the existing code with the minimal version above
3. Click "Save and Deploy"
Step 5: Test the Minimal Worker
Test with GET request:

bash
curl https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev/
Test with POST request:

bash
curl -X POST https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
You should get successful responses.
Step 6: Common Worker Errors and Fixes
If you're still getting errors, check these common issues:
1. Environment Variables Not Set
If your original code references env.PCO_APP_ID or env.PCO_SECRET but they're not set:
1. Go to Worker Settings → Variables
2. Add your environment variables:
    * PCO_APP_ID = your PCO app ID
    * PCO_SECRET = your PCO secret
2. Syntax Errors
The original code I provided might have issues. Common fixes:
* Remove any require() statements (not supported in Workers)
* Ensure all async/await is properly used
* Check for missing closing brackets
3. Using Node.js APIs
Cloudflare Workers don't support Node.js APIs like crypto. Use Web Crypto API instead:

javascript
// Wrong - Node.js crypto
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Right - Web Crypto API
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const data = encoder.encode(text);
Step 7: Gradual Integration
Once the minimal worker works, gradually add features:
Phase 1: Log Monday webhooks

javascript
if (request.method === 'POST') {
  const body = await request.json();
  console.log('Monday webhook:', JSON.stringify(body));
  
  // Just acknowledge for now
  return new Response('OK', { status: 200 });
}
Phase 2: Add PCO connection test

javascript
// Add this function
async function testPCOConnection(env) {
  const auth = btoa(`${env.PCO_APP_ID}:${env.PCO_SECRET}`);
  const response = await fetch('https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/me', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Basic ${auth}`
    }
  });
  return response.ok;
}
Step 8: Alternative - Use Pipedream
If Cloudflare Workers continue to be problematic, Pipedream is easier:
1. Create account at pipedream.com
2. New workflow → HTTP trigger
3. You get an instant webhook URL
4. Add code step with the PCO integration
Quick Debug Steps
1. Check deployment status:    bash # Should return your worker's response
2. curl -I https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev/   
3. View live logs:
    * Go to Cloudflare dashboard
    * Workers & Pages → your worker
    * Logs → Begin log stream
    * Make requests and watch errors
4. Check environment variables are set:
    * Settings → Variables
    * Ensure PCO_APP_ID and PCO_SECRET exist
Let me know what happens when you deploy the minimal worker, and we can build from there!

Diagnosed webhook error and proposed structural validation solution.

3s

The error shows that the code is trying to read event.type but event is undefined. This is happening because the test request {"test": true} doesn't have an event property. The worker code is expecting a Monday.com webhook structure but receiving a simple test object.
The user needs to update their worker to handle test requests properly and check for the existence of properties before accessing them.
Great! Your worker is deployed and receiving requests. The error shows it's trying to access event.type but the test payload doesn't have an event property. Let's fix your worker to handle both test requests and actual Monday webhooks:
Fixed Cloudflare Worker - Monday to PCO Sync
Code 
export default { async fetch(request, env) { // Handle CORS preflight if (request.method === 'OPTIONS') { return new Response(null, { status: 200, headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', 'Acc
Debugged webhook handler with robust error management techniques.

6s

I've created a fixed version of the worker that:
1. Properly handles test requests without trying to access event.type
2. Handles Monday.com challenge requests for webhook validation
3. Has better error handling and logging
4. Safely accesses nested properties with defaults
5. Checks for required environment variables
6. Provides clear error messages
The key fixes:
* Added a check for body.test === true before trying to access body.event
* Added handling for Monday.com challenge parameter
* Added null checks and default values throughout
* Better error messages to help with debugging
Deploy the Fixed Worker
1. Copy the entire code above
2. In your Cloudflare Worker dashboard, click "Quick Edit"
3. Replace ALL existing code with the fixed version
4. Click "Save and Deploy"
Test Again
Test with your simple request:

bash
curl -X POST https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
You should now get:

json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Test webhook received successfully",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-05T17:15:00.000Z"
}
Set Environment Variables
Before creating the Monday webhook, make sure your PCO credentials are set:
1. Go to your Worker Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add:
    * PCO_APP_ID = your PCO application ID
    * PCO_SECRET = your PCO secret
3. Save
Now Create the Monday Webhook
With the worker properly handling requests, try creating the webhook again:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0aWQiOjUwNDI5MjY3MCwiYWFpIjoxMSwidWlkIjo3MjQzNTU1MSwiaWFkIjoiMjAyNS0wNC0yNFQxNzozNDoxNi4wMDBaIiwicGVyIjoibWU6d3JpdGUiLCJhY3RpZCI6MjA1MDI1MTAsInJnbiI6InVzZTEifQ.sp2Al9PQ-gTQc8V0Ppf5NTBZjYR_q-vdk6hnIEUbusc" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { create_webhook(board_id: \"9302420826\", url: \"https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev\", event: create_item) { id } }"
  }'
What This Fixed Worker Does
1. Handles test requests - Returns success for {"test": true}
2. Handles Monday challenge - Monday sends a challenge parameter to verify webhooks
3. Better error handling - Won't crash on missing properties
4. Comprehensive logging - Check your Worker logs to see exactly what's happening
5. Checks for PCO credentials - Warns if environment variables aren't set
Next Steps
Once the webhook is created:
1. Create a test item in your Monday board
2. Watch the Worker logs to see the webhook data
3. Check PCO to see if the person/note was created
The worker now handles all the edge cases that were causing the error!

Strategized webhook integration and next testing steps.

4s

Excellent! The user has successfully:
1. Fixed their Cloudflare Worker (it's now responding properly to test requests)
2. Created a webhook in Monday.com (ID: 432530600)
This is great progress. Now they need to:
1. Test the actual integration by creating an item in Monday
2. Set up the webhook for updates as well
3. Monitor the logs to ensure everything is working
I should congratulate them and provide next steps for testing and creating the update webhook.
Excellent! 🎉 Your webhook has been successfully created! The webhook ID is 432530600.
Next Steps to Test Your Integration
1. First, Make Sure PCO Credentials Are Set
Go to your Cloudflare Worker:
1. Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add:
    * PCO_APP_ID = your PCO app ID
    * PCO_SECRET = your PCO secret
3. Click "Encrypt" for each and Save
2. Test the Integration
Create a test item in your Monday.com board:
1. Go to your Care Tracking board (ID: 9302420826)
2. Create a new item with:
    * Person Needing Care: "Test Person"
    * Submitter Email: a valid email address
    * Care Type: "Prayer Request"
    * Priority: "Normal"
    * Details: "This is a test entry"
3. Monitor the Logs
Watch your Cloudflare Worker logs:
1. Go to your Worker dashboard
2. Click "Logs" → "Begin log stream"
3. Create the item in Monday
4. Watch for the webhook to arrive
4. Create the Update Webhook
Now create a second webhook for updates:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0aWQiOjUwNDI5MjY3MCwiYWFpIjoxMSwidWlkIjo3MjQzNTU1MSwiaWFkIjoiMjAyNS0wNC0yNFQxNzozNDoxNi4wMDBaIiwicGVyIjoibWU6d3JpdGUiLCJhY3RpZCI6MjA1MDI1MTAsInJnbiI6InVzZTEifQ.sp2Al9PQ-gTQc8V0Ppf5NTBZjYR_q-vdk6hnIEUbusc" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "mutation { create_webhook(board_id: \"9302420826\", url: \"https://monday-pco-sync.jeremy-caf.workers.dev\", event: change_column_value) { id } }"
  }'
5. List Your Webhooks (Optional)
To see all webhooks on your board:

bash
curl -X POST https://api.monday.com/v2 \
  -H "Authorization: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0aWQiOjUwNDI5MjY3MCwiYWFpIjoxMSwidWlkIjo3MjQzNTU1MSwiaWFkIjoiMjAyNS0wNC0yNFQxNzozNDoxNi4wMDBaIiwicGVyIjoibWU6d3JpdGUiLCJhY3RpZCI6MjA1MDI1MTAsInJnbiI6InVzZTEifQ.sp2Al9PQ-gTQc8V0Ppf5NTBZjYR_q-vdk6hnIEUbusc" \

  -d '{
    "query": "query { webhooks(board_id: \"9302420826\") { id, event, config } }"
  }'
6. Check PCO for Results
After creating a test item:
1. Go to Planning Center People
2. Search for the email address you used
3. Check if:
    * Person was created (if new)
    * Note was added with care details
    * Custom fields were updated (if you set those up)
Troubleshooting
If it's not working, check:
1. Worker Logs - What's the exact error?
2. Column Names - Make sure your Monday columns match what the worker expects:
    * submitter_email (or email)
    * care_type
    * priority

Verified webhook configurations for Monday.com board integration.

2s

The user has successfully created both webhooks:
1. ID 432530600 for create_item events
2. ID 432533577 for change_column_value events
Both webhooks are now active and will send data to their Cloudflare Worker. Now they need to test it by creating an item in their Monday.com board.
Perfect! Both webhooks are successfully created:
* Create Item Webhook: ID 432530600 ✅
* Update Column Webhook: ID 432533577 ✅
Your integration is now ready to test!
Test Your Integration Now
Step 1: Create a Test Item in Monday.com
Go to your Care Tracking board and create a new item with these columns filled:
* Person Needing Care: "Test Person" (or any name)
* Submitter Email: Use a real email address (yours or a test email)
* Care Type: Select one from your dropdown
* Priority: Select a priority level
* Details/Notes: "Testing Monday to PCO integration"
Step 2: Watch Your Worker Logs
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Navigate to Workers & Pages → monday-pco-sync
3. Click "Logs" → "Begin log stream"
4. Keep this window open while you create the item
Step 3: What You Should See
In the logs, you should see something like:

Received webhook: {"event":{"type":"create_item"...}}
Processing Monday event type: create_item
Handling new item creation
Item data: {"boardId":"9302420826","itemId":"...","itemName":"Test Person"...}
Searching for person with email: test@example.com
...
Step 4: Verify in PCO
1. Go to Planning Center People
2. Search for the email address you used
3. You should see:
    * The person record (created or updated)
    * A new note with the care request details
Troubleshooting Common Issues
If Nothing Appears in Logs
Monday might not be sending the webhook. Try:
1. Creating another item
2. Checking if your Monday board is the correct one (ID: 9302420826)
If You See "Missing PCO credentials"
1. Go to Cloudflare Worker Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add:
    * Variable name: PCO_APP_ID → Your app ID
    * Variable name: PCO_SECRET → Your secret
3. Click "Encrypt" next to each value
4. Save and redeploy
If You See Column Parsing Errors
Check your Monday.com column names. The worker expects:
* Email column named: submitter_email or email
* Care type column named: care_type
* Priority column named: priority
* Details column named: details or notes
You can check your actual column names by looking at the webhook payload in the logs.
Quick Column Name Fix
If your columns have different names, you can either:
1. Rename columns in Monday to match what the worker expects
2. Or update the worker code to match your column names
To see your actual column names, look for this line in the logs:

Parsed columns: {"your_actual_column_names_here":...}
Test an Update
Once the create webhook works:
1. Go to an existing item in your board
2. Change any column value (like Status or Priority)
3. Check logs for the update webhook
4. Verify a new note appears in PCO
Let me know what you see in the logs when you create a test item!

Validated Monday.com webhook and prepared for test item creation.

5s

The user is seeing the Monday.com challenge response in their logs. This is good - it means Monday.com successfully validated the webhook endpoint. The challenge is part of Monday's webhook verification process. When you first create a webhook, Monday sends a challenge parameter and expects it to be echoed back. The worker correctly handled this.
Now the user needs to actually create an item in their Monday board to test the real integration. The webhook is set up and validated, so the next step is to create a test item.
Great! That's the Monday.com webhook validation challenge - your webhook is now verified and active! Monday.com sends this challenge when first setting up a webhook to confirm your endpoint is responding correctly.
Your Integration is Ready!
Now create an actual item in your Monday board to test the real integration:
Create a Test Item
1. Go to your Monday.com board (Care Tracking)
2. Click "+ New Item" or "+ Add item"
3. Fill in:
    * Item name: "Test Care Request"
    * Submitter Email: your email address
    * Care Type: Select any option
    * Priority: Select any level
    * Details: "Testing PCO integration"
Watch the Logs
Keep your Cloudflare log stream open. When you create the item, you should see:

Received webhook: {"event":{"type":"create_item"...
Processing Monday event type: create_item
Handling new item creation
...
Important: Check Column Names
If you don't see the expected data, the webhook payload will show your actual column names. Look for a log entry like:

Parsed columns: {"email_1":..., "status4":..., "text8":...}
Monday.com uses internal column IDs (like email_1, text8) rather than display names. You'll need to map these to the correct fields.
If Nothing Happens
Sometimes Monday takes a few seconds to send the webhook. If nothing appears:
1. Try creating another item
2. Make sure you clicked "Save" or confirmed the item creation
3. Check that you're watching the correct board
Next Step
Once you create an item and see the webhook in your logs, let me know:
1. What appears in the logs
2. If there are any errors
3. What the actual column IDs are (from the "Parsed columns" log)
Then we can adjust the column mapping if needed to make sure the data flows correctly to PCO!

Decoded webhook data and identified column mapping discrepancies.

6s

Great! The webhook is working and I can see the data coming through. Looking at the logs, I can see:
1. The webhook is being received successfully
2. The actual column IDs are visible in the parsed columns
3. There are two email columns: email_mkrkkywc and email_mkrkr549
4. The care type is in color_mkrk2646 with label "Prayer Support"
5. The priority is in the status column
6. The details are in long_text_mkrkff7z
7. There's also phone numbers and addresses
The issue is that the worker is looking for columns named submitter_email, care_type, etc., but Monday is using internal IDs like email_mkrkkywc.
We need to update the mapping in the worker code to use these actual column IDs.
Perfect! The webhook is working and I can see all your data. The issue is that the worker is looking for column names that don't match your actual Monday.com column IDs. Let me update the worker to use your actual column mappings:
Looking at your data:
* Submitter Name: text_mkrkgaj6 = "Jeremy Silbernagel"
* Submitter Email: email_mkrkkywc = "jeremy@gracefm.org"
* Person Email: email_mkrkr549 = "jersilb@gmail.com"
* Phone Numbers: phone_mkrkrbbw and phone_mkrkt8q8
* Care Type: color_mkrk2646 = "Prayer Support"
* Priority: status = "Normal"
* Details: long_text_mkrkff7z = "Needs daily prayer support please."
* Address: text_mkrkw78h = "222 Main St. Winnsboro, TX 75494"
Let me update the worker code with your column mappings:

Let me check the code one more time to make sure I got all the changes correctly. The worker should now be properly mapping the actual Monday.com column IDs to the data structure.
Updated Worker Deployed!
Now your worker is updated with the correct column mappings for your Monday board. Here's what I changed:
1. Mapped your actual column IDs:
    * text_mkrkgaj6 → Submitter Name
    * email_mkrkkywc → Submitter Email
    * email_mkrkr549 → Person Email
    * phone_mkrkrbbw/phone_mkrkt8q8 → Phone Numbers
    * color_mkrk2646 → Care Type
    * status → Priority
    * long_text_mkrkff7z → Details
    * text_mkrkw78h → Address
2. Enhanced email handling - Uses submitter email first, falls back to person email
3. Added phone formatting - Formats numbers like (817) 584-1626
4. Improved note content - Includes all available information
Deploy the Updated Code
1. Copy the updated code from the artifact above
2. Go to your Cloudflare Worker
3. Click "Quick Edit"
4. Replace all code with the updated version
5. Click "Save and Deploy"
Set Your PCO Credentials
If you haven't already:
1. Go to Worker Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add:
    * PCO_APP_ID = your PCO app ID
    * PCO_SECRET = your PCO secret
3. Click "Encrypt" and Save
Test Again
Now when you create an item in Monday, it should successfully:
1. Extract the email (jeremy@gracefm.org)
2. Search/create person in PCO
3. Add a comprehensive note with all the care details
Watch your logs - you should see it progress through finding the person and creating the note!

Diagnosed integration issues and strategized solution implementation.

5s

Great! The integration is working mostly well. I can see:
1. The person was found successfully (ID: 163050178)
2. But the note creation failed because PCO requires a note_category_id
Also, I can see the updates are coming through:
* Case ID update
* Date update
* Assigned to update
Let me fix the note creation issue and also handle the Case ID that's coming from the update webhook.
Excellent progress! The integration is working - it found the person in PCO (ID: 163050178) but failed to create the note because PCO requires a note_category_id. Let me fix this issue:



Plotted strategy for implementing note category function.

Now I need to add the getOrCreateNoteCategory function.



Strategized function updates for note creation and case handling.

Let me also update the note creation to pass the env parameter and handle the categoryId properly.



Investigated webhook updates and worker handling improvements.

I also noticed from the logs that there are update webhooks coming through. The Case ID webhook shows the ID is 13, which suggests they're using an auto-number column. Let me make sure the worker handles this properly and also improve the update handler to actually create notes for updates.

Analyzed case integration, noted updates and potential enhancements.

8s

I notice from the logs that the person (Jeremy) was found, and the integration is working well. The only error was the missing note_category_id, which I've now fixed. I also see that the Case ID from the Monday auto-number column shows as 13, so I've updated the formatting to use CARE-2025-013 format.
I should also note that I can see update webhooks are being received successfully for:
1. Case ID updates
2. Date field updates
3. Assigned to updates
These are all being acknowledged but not creating additional notes yet. That could be a future enhancement.
Deploy the Updated Worker
I've made several important fixes:
1. Fixed Note Creation - Now handles PCO's required note_category_id
2. Added Note Categories - Automatically creates "Care Updates" category if it doesn't exist
3. Improved Case ID - Uses your auto-number field: CARE-2025-013 format
4. Added Custom Field Updates - If you have PCO custom fields configured
5. Better Error Handling - More graceful handling of missing categories
Deploy Now:
1. Copy the updated code from the artifact
2. Go to your Cloudflare Worker dashboard
3. Click "Quick Edit"
4. Replace all code
5. Click "Save and Deploy"
What's Working:
✅ Person Found: Jeremy was found in PCO (ID: 163050178) ✅ Data Extraction: All fields properly mapped ✅ Updates Received: Column updates are being received ❌ Note Failed: Due to missing category (now fixed)
Test the Fix:
Create another item in Monday, and you should see:
* Person found/created in PCO
* Note successfully created with "Care Updates" category
* Case ID formatted as CARE-2025-XXX
Your Column Updates:
I can see these updates coming through:
* Case ID: Auto-numbered (13)
* Date: 2025-06-05
* Assigned to: Person assigned
These could be used to create update notes in PCO, but for now they're just acknowledged.
The integration is working great - just deploy this fix for the note category issue!

Excellent! The integration is now working perfectly. Looking at the logs:
1. ✅ Person found in PCO (ID: 163050178)
2. ✅ All three custom fields updated successfully:
    * Care Case ID: CASE-9313424832
    * Care Status: Active
    * Care Type: Hospital Visit
3. ✅ Note category found (ID: 267504)
4. ✅ Note created successfully
The entire flow is working end-to-end. When a new care request is created in Monday.com:
* It finds or creates the person in PCO
* Updates custom fields with the care information
* Creates a detailed note with all the care request details
The user should verify this in PCO by:
1. Going to Planning Center People
2. Searching for Jeremy (jeremy@gracefm.org)
3. Checking that:
    * Custom fields are populated
    * A new note exists under "Care Updates" category
    * The note contains all the care details
The integration is complete and functional!
